# Flashcard Project

This project was made for students or anyone studying something to be able to create a deck of studying flashcards. Using flashcards can be a very effective self-testing approach. Flashcards are often part of spaced practice, and repetition helps you figure out what information you can remember easily and what needs additional effort.

This project helped me practice using React! I remember having trouble managing my useEffect hooks. But as soon as I started to separate them into smaller functions they became much more manageable. This project was fun and I want to go back and add some CSS styling.


## Goals

- Installing packages via NPM.
- Running tests from the command line.
- Writing React function components.
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory().
- Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger.
## Tech Stack

**Tools:** Javascript, React

**Client:** React

**Server:** This file has data hard coded in. This was made just to test the React skills so no API was connected.
